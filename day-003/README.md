## Summary:

each thread is responsible to handle more than one element of the vector. so the thread to data (data unit, here I mean vector element) mapping is not one-on-one like the previous days.

## What I learned:

- Exploiting the computational power of each thread, requires feeding enough (not too much) instruction and data to it. Since flipping a boolean value is not dealing with that much of data or complicated operations, why not do 2?
