This kernel performs vector addition for two floating-point vectors of numbers.

I read the PMPP till the end of chapter 2, and learned (and also reviewd!) plenty of good points, including but not limited to:
different design philosophies for CPU and GPU
where parallelsim can actually be effective, how to calculate the overall enhancement
memory allocation, and deallocation in CUDA C
free memory block and data transfers in CUDA C
writing kernel code and reserved(or predefined) variables for distiguishing host and device functions
concept of grid, thread block (or block), dimensions and thread indexing in CUDA
